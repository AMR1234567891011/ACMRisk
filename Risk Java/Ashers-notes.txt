Why not use classes instead of arrays of objects for players during the draft, attack, and move phase. 
maybe have the classes
draft {
    int troops;
    Province target;

    bool is Valid(){};
}

attack {
    int troops;
    Province attacker;
    Province defender;

    bool isValid(){};


}

move {
    int troops;
    Province target;
    Province source;

    bool isValid(){};
}
